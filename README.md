## Project Overview
OS-Vigilante is a project developed for the TMF2234 Operating System course. The primary focus of this project is the implementation of the Round Robin scheduling algorithm. Given a file with a list of jobs, our system will schedule and execute these jobs based on the Round Robin algorithm, ensuring fair CPU time allocation and efficient process management. This project serves as a practical exploration of process scheduling in operating systems, demonstrating the impact of different scheduling algorithms on system performance.

## Installation
1. Make sure your compiler running on latest version
2. Else, add the following commands to your IDE
   Dev C++ --> Tools -> Compiler options -> Check the ""Add the following commands when calling the compiler"
            -> Add the commands "-std=c++11"
3. Compile and run.
